# Milestones
A(nother) Markdown processor that compiles Markdown to a LaTeX document. Specifically targets CVs and Resumes.

## Goals

  * Serialize down to LaTeX directives wherever possible.
  * Do not use any third-party libraries for the LaTeX document.

## Progress

  * Should be relatively functional as of right now (for most text), but still needs to be run through Maven.
  * Need to implement a number of features, such as tables, still.
